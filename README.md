# Introduction to D3.js

This project provides a simple introduction to using D3.js for data visualization. We use npm to install necessary packages such as d3, parcel, and We use Parcel as our bundler and development server to streamline the build process and serve our code locally.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 12 or higher)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### 1. Clone the Repository

I have written comments in each .mjs file where the d3.js implementation resides to help you gain a better understanding of the purpose and usability of certain snippets.
